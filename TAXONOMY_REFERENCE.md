# Blog Taxonomy Reference

This document serves as a reference for the categories and tags used in the Berean's Blog. Use this to maintain consistency across posts.

## Categories
*Broad groupings for posts.*

*   **Introduction**: Posts that introduce the blog, the author, or major new series.
*   **Biblical Studies**: Exegesis of specific scripture passages not strictly tied to a Proposition.
*   **Historical Theology**: Examinations of how the Kingdom has been viewed throughout church history.
*   **Ecclesiology**: The study of the Church, its role in the present age, and its distinction from the Kingdom.
*   **Eschatology**: The study of end times, prophecy, the Millennium, and the future Kingdom.
*   **Systematic Theology**: Discussions on specific doctrines, definitions, and how theological concepts interrelate.
*   **Hermeneutics**: Posts focusing on the methods of interpretation (literal vs. spiritualizing).
*   **Reflections**: Personal thoughts or applications of the theology.
*   **Modern Theology**: Analysis of contemporary theological trends and their impact on Kingdom doctrine.

## Tags
*Specific keywords to describe the content.*
