Welcome to **The Bereans Blog**, a digital study dedicated to rediscovering and examining the monumental work of George N.H. Peters, *The Theocratic Kingdom*.

## Our Mission

The primary goal of this site is to walk systematically through the propositions laid out by G.N.H. Peters in his three-volume masterpiece, *The Theocratic Kingdom of Our Lord Jesus, the Christ, as Covenanted in the Old Testament and Presented in the New Testament*.

Published in 1884, Peters' work remains one of the most exhaustive defenses of the premillennial kingdom ever written. Yet, due to its sheer size and depth, it is often overlooked. This blog seeks to make his arguments accessible, digestible, and verifiable for the modern student of Scripture.

## Why "Bereans"?

The name is inspired by the Jews of Berea in Acts 17:11:

> "Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so."

We do not accept Peters' conclusions simply because he wrote them. Like the Bereans, our aim is to test every proposition against the Word of God. We invite you to join us in this "daily examination," looking past tradition and theological systems to see what the text itself declares about the coming Kingdom.

## What We Believe

This study is grounded in a literal, grammatical-historical interpretation of Scripture. We hold that:
*   The Covenants (Abrahamic, Davidic, New) are unconditional and literal.
*   The Kingdom offered by Jesus was the same Kingdom predicted by the prophets.
*   The Church is a distinct work of God, but does not replace Israel or cancel the promises made to the fathers.
*   Jesus Christ will return physically to reign on the throne of David on this earth.
