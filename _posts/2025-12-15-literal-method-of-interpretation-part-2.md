In the previous post, we addressed the **logic of language**—why grammatical interpretation is not optional if God intends to communicate truthfully. But logic alone does not decide the issue. History must also be heard.

The most persistent objection to literal interpretation is not that it is *wrong*, but that it is *primitive*. Critics imply that grammatical reading belongs to an early, unsophisticated stage of Christian thought—one that the Church outgrew as it matured.

Peters answers this charge by appealing not to theory, but to **history itself**.

---

## The Appeal to Antiquity

Peters insists that grammatical interpretation was not merely one option among many in the early Church—it was the *default*.

<div class="peters-quote">
“The primitive Church occupied this position… what the understanding can daily make use of, what it can easily know, is that which lies before our eyes, unambiguously, literally, and clearly in Holy Writ.”
<br>— <em>Prop. 4, Obs. 1</em>
</div>

This posture did not emerge in a vacuum. It stood in continuity with the **earliest Jewish approach to Scripture**, particularly after the Babylonian exile, when the people of Israel—removed from temple and land—were forced to cling to the written Word itself.

The Palestinian Jewish tradition emphasized:

* words in context,
* sentences in their grammatical setting,
* Scripture interpreting Scripture,
* and careful attention to figures of speech without dissolving history.

This was not naïve literalism. It was disciplined reading.

Yet alongside this tradition, a **competing approach was already forming**.

What is often overlooked is that this grammatical approach carried with it a corresponding *eschatology*. The earliest Christian writers did not merely read Scripture literally in theory; they did so consistently in areas where it mattered most—particularly in their expectation of the Kingdom.

The historical record shows that chiliasm—the belief in a future, visible, earthly reign of Christ—was not a marginal position in the ante-Nicene Church. It was the prevailing view. Early writers such as Papias, Justin Martyr, and Irenaeus expressed no sense that they were innovating or speculating. Their confidence flowed naturally from reading the prophets and apostles as meaning what they said.

Notably, there is little evidence of controversy over the millennium in the first centuries. That silence speaks volumes. A view rarely argued against is usually one that has not yet been challenged. The absence of debate suggests not confusion, but consensus.

This historical reality reinforces Peters’ point: the grammatical method did not *produce* an eccentric doctrine of the Kingdom. It preserved the one already embedded in Scripture.


### The Fork in the Road: Jerusalem and Alexandria

The great hermeneutical divide did not originate within Christianity—it predated it.

In Alexandria, Greek philosophy dominated intellectual life. There, Jewish thinkers like **Philo** faced a dilemma: how to reconcile Hebrew Scripture with Platonic philosophy. <span class="kingdom-gold">The solution was not to submit philosophy to Scripture, but to **reinterpret Scripture through philosophy**.</span>

Philo adopted an already-existing Greek technique—**allegory**—used to sanitize the morally troubling myths of Homer. History became expendable; ideas were supreme.

Scripture, Philo taught, had a *body* and a *soul*. The literal sense was for the immature. The allegorical sense was the true meaning—hidden, philosophical, and elite. The Alexandrian impulse was not driven by biblical difficulty but by philosophical discomfort. Prophecy that promised an earthly reign, national restoration, and visible judgment sat uneasily with Platonic ideals of immaterial perfection. Allegory became the solvent that dissolved those tensions.

Once Scripture could be said to mean *something other than what it said*, the Kingdom no longer needed to arrive in history. It could be relocated into the soul, the Church, or heaven itself—anywhere but where the prophets placed it.

That fork in the road would soon cross into Christianity.

## The Trojan Horse of Allegory

Peters identifies the decisive moment with unmistakable clarity:

<div class="peters-quote">
The early Christians in their simplicity and faith occupied our posture, and therefore held a doctrine concerning the kingdom, which, by a change to another attitude, is now regarded by the masses as erroneous. We are mainly indebted to Origen for this transformation, he giving the leverage through which it was accomplished.
<br>— <em>Prop. 4, Obs. 6</em>
</div>

Origen did not deny the literal sense. He **demoted it**;

<div class="peters-quote">
“He laid down the principle ‘*that the Scriptures are of little use to those who understand them as they are written*.’”
</div>

Rather then understanding the Scriptures *as they are written*, Origen urged readers to seek a hidden meaning. Adopting Philo’s framework, Origen proposed a threefold meaning of Scripture:

* body (literal),
* soul (moral),
* spirit (allegorical).

The literal sense was tolerated—but treated as inferior. The “spiritual” sense was where truth supposedly lived.

Peters is blunt about the consequences. Once the grammatical sense is declared inadequate, the interpreter becomes sovereign.

Bernard Ramm explains the danger succinctly:

>“Allegorical interpretation is the method of interpreting a literary text in terms of something else… It introduces into the text ideas that are foreign to the author’s intent.” — *Bernard Ramm, <span style="font-style:italic;">Protestant Biblical Interpretation</span>*

Meaning was no longer *discovered*. It was *assigned*.

## From Exception to Empire: Allegory Becomes the Norm

What began as an intellectual accommodation soon hardened into an interpretive system.

By the medieval period, allegory was no longer a method—it was a **regime**. Scripture was subjected to the fourfold sense:

* literal,
* allegorical,
* moral,
* anagogical.

History became merely the lowest rung on the ladder.

Peters notes the tragic irony: even those who admitted the literal sense felt compelled to **move beyond it** to find the “real” meaning. The Bible became pliable—what he elsewhere likens to *alchemical wax*.

This system produced immense creativity—and immense instability.

## A Compressed Timeline: From Apostolic Expectation to Institutional Stability

To understand why allegory proved so resilient, it helps to trace the path it took—not as an abstraction, but as a historical progression.

### 1. The Early Church (c. AD 100–300): Literal Reading, Literal Hope
The earliest Christians inherited both the Jewish Scriptures and the Jewish way of reading them. They interpreted prophecy historically, grammatically, and concretely—and they expected the Kingdom accordingly.

This produced what later critics would call *chiliasm*: the expectation of a future, visible, earthly reign of Christ. But to the early Church, this was not a theory. It was simply the natural outcome of reading the prophets and apostles as meaning what they said.

There is little evidence of sustained controversy over the millennium in this period. That silence is telling. Where interpretation is shared, debate is minimal.

The early Church did not spiritualize the Kingdom because it had no reason to. It was persecuted, marginalized, and politically powerless. A future, disruptive intervention by God made sense of both Scripture and experience.

### 2. Origen (3rd Century): Allegory as an Interpretive Tool

The decisive shift begins not with rejection, but with *re-ranking*.

Origen did not deny the literal sense of Scripture; he subordinated it. Influenced by Philo and Platonism, he viewed physical promises as crude and unworthy of divine dignity. Allegory provided a way to retain Scripture while escaping its material implications.

This was the moment when allegory ceased to be an occasional explanation and became a **principle**.

Once the grammatical sense could be set aside whenever it conflicted with philosophical sensibilities, prophecy lost its governing role. The Kingdom no longer had to arrive in history. It could be realized internally.

This was the lever Peters identifies. The door, once opened, would not easily close.

### 3. Augustine (5th Century): Allegory Systematized

What Origen introduced, Augustine of Hippo institutionalized.

Confronted with the collapse of Rome and the rise of a Christianized empire, Augustine redefined the Kingdom in a way that could not fail politically or historically. In *The City of God*, the millennium was relocated from the future to the present, from the earth to the Church. The Kingdom was no longer something history was moving *toward*; it was something already fully underway.

Alongside this, Augustine consistently emphasized a spiritual interpretation of biblical promises and covenants. The language of land, nation, throne, and restoration was re-read through an ecclesial lens. Israel’s ongoing national role quietly receded, replaced by a universal, spiritual *people of God* identified with the Church.

* The “thousand years” became symbolic.
* The reign of Christ became spiritual.
* The first resurrection became regeneration.
* The Kingdom became ecclesial.

This move achieved remarkable stability. A Kingdom defined this way could survive the fall of empires, the chaos of history, and the failure of political expectations. But that stability came at a cost: allegory was no longer an occasional interpretive tool—it became the governing principle.

Once Revelation 20 was spiritualized, consistency demanded that the Old Testament prophets be treated the same way. Kingdom promises to Israel could no longer retain their national or historical force without threatening the entire system.

The result was not merely amillennialism, but **supersessionism**—later called *replacement theology*. If the Kingdom is spiritual, its people must also be spiritualized. Israel’s concrete, national promises were absorbed into the Church, not by explicit polemic, but by theological gravity.

{% capture supersessionism %}
This was not a conclusion drawn *from* the Old Testament text so much as a conclusion read *back into* it. Once the Kingdom was redefined as a present, spiritual reality embodied in the Church, Israel itself had to be reinterpreted to fit the new framework. The clear, national, territorial promises given to Abraham and David were no longer allowed to mean what they plainly said; they were reclassified as shadows, types, or symbols whose “true” fulfillment lay elsewhere.

In practice, this meant that the Church became the hermeneutical key for the Old Testament. Israel was no longer read as Israel, but as a provisional figure for a later, spiritual people. Land became “inheritance in Christ” (reframed from passages such as Galatians 3:29). Kingship became “Christ’s spiritual rule” (Ephesians 1:20–22). Restoration became “conversion” (Acts 3:19, detached from its immediate context). What Scripture presented as covenantal promises to a nation were transformed into metaphors for individual salvation or ecclesial blessing.

This spiritualization was then retroactively justified by selective appeals to the New Testament. Texts such as Galatians 3:7–9, Galatians 3:16, and Galatians 3:28–29 were treated as dissolving Israel’s national identity into a purely spiritual category. Ephesians 2:14–16 was pressed to mean the erasure of Israel rather than the reconciliation of Jew and Gentile in one body. 1 Peter 2:9—covenant language drawn directly from Exodus 19:5–6—was cited as proof that the Church had assumed Israel’s role in totality. Meanwhile, Paul’s explicit distinctions regarding Israel’s ongoing identity and future for three full chapters in Romans were minimized.

Historically, this is the basic logic of **supersessionism** (often called “replacement theology”): the Church is treated as the new or true Israel, inheriting Israel’s covenant role and promises. It became a dominant assumption in large stretches of Christian tradition, and it still functions as the default “background setting” in many churches—sometimes loudly (hard replacement), more often quietly (soft replacement: Israel has no distinct covenantal future worth mentioning).[^1]

The danger of this approach is not merely eschatological. Once replacement becomes the governing assumption, Scripture is no longer permitted to define its own terms. Promises are dissolved into principles. History is absorbed into theology. And the faithfulness of God to His explicit covenants is subtly subordinated to a system that requires those covenants to mean something other than what they say.

And the downstream effects were not only interpretive. When supersessionism hardened into punitive forms (“Israel is cast off; therefore Jews should be suppressed”), it helped provide theological plausibility for contempt. Martin Luther, while a monumental figure, is an unfortunate case: late in life he produced virulently anti-Jewish writings—most notoriously *On the Jews and Their Lies* (1543)—calling for actions such as burning synagogues and destroying Jewish homes and texts.[^2] Later Lutheran bodies have publicly repudiated those anti-Jewish views and urged repentance for Christian complicity in anti-Jewish hatred.[^3]

In short, supersessionism is not an isolated doctrine but the logical outcome of a prior hermeneutical decision: when the Kingdom is spiritualized, Israel must be spiritualized with it. The cost of that decision is nothing less than the loss of the Bible’s own covenantal storyline, God’s immutability, and the integrity of prophetic fulfillment.

Augustine did not invent this logic, but by embedding it in a comprehensive vision of history, Scripture, and the Church, he gave it intellectual credibility and institutional staying power. Once baptized by Augustine’s authority, supersessionism became the default assumption of Western Christianity for centuries—rarely argued for, rarely questioned, and almost never revisited.

### 4. The Reformation (16th Century): Partial Recovery, Lingering Blind Spots

The Reformers recovered much that had been lost: the authority of Scripture, justification by faith, and the right of private interpretation. They decisively rejected Rome’s claim to control meaning.

But on prophecy and the Kingdom, the Reformation was largely conservative rather than corrective.

The Reformers inherited Augustine’s eschatology along with Augustine’s allegorical assumptions. While they restored the grammatical method in many doctrinal areas, they did not consistently reapply it to prophetic texts.

In Peters’ assessment, the Reformation corrected *who* had authority over Scripture, but not fully *how* Scripture was read—especially where the Kingdom was concerned.

The result was a Church free from Rome, yet still shaped by Alexandrian habits of interpretation.

### 5. The Ongoing Divide

What emerges from this timeline is not confusion, but causation.

Literal interpretation produces a future Kingdom.
Allegorical interpretation neutralizes it.
Institutional Christianity requires stability.
Allegory provides it.

The modern debate is not new. It is the continuation of an ancient choice—between allowing Scripture to govern expectation, or reshaping expectation to fit the present age.

## Answering the “Gotcha” Verses    

Against this backdrop, Peters turns to the texts most often used to justify allegory.

### “The Letter Kills” (2 Corinthians 3:6)

Peters calls this appeal not merely mistaken, but destructive.

<div class="peters-quote">
“If the ‘literal’ application ‘killeth,’ how does it come then that God gives His word in such a form? …Would He give truth surrounded by a deadly covering?”
<br>— <em>Prop. 4, Obs. 3</em>
</div>

To make this verse condemn grammatical interpretation is, Peters argues, to indict God Himself.

The contrast is not between literal and spiritual interpretation, but between **Christless possession of truth** and **Christ-filled fulfillment of it**. The letter without Christ condemns; the letter fulfilled in Christ gives life.

<div class="peters-quote">
The simple, unpretending meaning of the verse is this: that the Word of God in its letter (i.e. in its plain, unambiguous written form) cannot
give life; that possessing the letter alone would inevitably lead to death, for having only the letter the
covenant promises could not be realized, but that having the Spirit, even Christ, the assurance is given
that the letter itself—death without Christ or the Spirit—or the promises of God contained in the letter,
shall be duly verified and accomplished
<br>— <em>Prop. 4, Obs. 3</em>
</div>

---

### “Spiritually Discerned” (1 Corinthians 2:14)

Here again Peters dismantles the mystical reading:

<div class="peters-quote">
“‘Spiritually discerned’ is discerning ‘the things of the Spirit,’ i.e., things given by the Spirit… submitting ourselves to the guidance and enlightening influence of the Spirit through the written Word.”
</div>

The Spirit does not replace the text. He illumines it.

Ramm reinforces the boundary:

>“Illumination does not mean new truth or hidden meanings. It is the Spirit’s aid in understanding what has already been revealed.”— *Bernard Ramm, <span style="font-style:italic;">Protestant Biblical Interpretation</span>*

Once “spiritual discernment” becomes license to add meaning, Scripture is no longer authoritative.

---

## The Cost of Departure

Peters presses the issue further. Allegory does not merely confuse—it **forces dangerous concessions**.

When unbelievers point out that Scripture plainly teaches a future, visible Kingdom, many theologians concede the point—and then retreat behind an added “inner sense.”

Peters records this with undisguised alarm.

<div class="peters-quote">
“The apostles and early believers are made to put their faith in a ‘chimera,’ a ‘materialistic husk,’ which later ages discard as error.”
</div>

The result is catastrophic:

* the apostles become naïve,
* early believers become mistaken,
* the Church becomes wiser than Scripture,
* and the Bible’s authority collapses under its own reinterpretation.

Ramm reaches the same conclusion from a methodological angle. Once theology is constructed on meanings that are not anchored in the text itself, doctrinal certainty becomes impossible.

>“To build doctrine upon meanings that are not demonstrable from the text itself is to abandon the only objective control interpretation possesses.” — *Bernard Ramm, <span style="font-style:italic;">Protestant Biblical Interpretation</span>*

At that point, disagreement is no longer an accident, it is inevitable.

---

## Standing on Solid Ground

Peters ends where he began—with a rule that predates the controversy:

<div class="peters-quote">
“Where a literal construction will stand, the furthest from the letter is commonly the worst.”
<br>— <em>Hooker</em>
</div>

This is not stubbornness. It is reverence.

The grammatical–historical method does not flatten Scripture. It **anchors it**—preserving unity, doctrine, promise, and hope.

To abandon it is not progress. It is regression disguised as insight.

To retain it is not naïveté. It is faithfulness.
