If you were to walk into five different churches this Sunday and ask the pastors to define the "Kingdom of God," you would likely receive five mutually exclusive answers. To one, it is the institutional Church itself, the visible hierarchy of believers; to another, it is a progressive movement for social justice, economic equity, and political reform; to a third, it is a subjective sense of inner peace or the "reign of God in the heart"; to a fourth, it is a mystical, existential encounter with the divine; and to a fifth, it is simply a synonym for heaven, the ethereal place we go when we die.

We often assume this theological juggling is a strictly modern phenomenon, perhaps a byproduct of postmodern deconstruction, 20th-century liberal drift, or the fracturing of denominations. But over a century ago, the premillennialist theologian George N.H. Peters identified this exact crisis. In *The Theocratic Kingdom*, Peters argued that <span class="kingdom-gold">abandoning the literal, covenanted definition of the Kingdom</span>—specifically its rooting in the Davidic Covenant—<span class="kingdom-gold">leads inevitably to theological chaos.</span>

In **Proposition 3**, Peters laid out a critique that is as devastating and relevant today as it was in 1884. He foresaw that without a specific anchor, the "Kingdom" would become a wax nose, shaped by the cultural and philosophical preferences of every passing generation.

<div class="proposition">
  <span class="prop-title">Prop. 3</span>
  “The meanings usually given to this Kingdom indicate that the most vague, indefinite notions concerning it exist in the minds of many”
</div>

### **The Diagnosis: Vague and Indefinite Notions**

Peters did not mince words regarding the state of Kingdom theology. He observed that once the anchor of the literal Davidic throne is removed, the definition of the Kingdom loses its objective reality and <span class="kingdom-gold">drifts into pure subjectivity.</span> Without the specific geopolitical and covenanted parameters provided by the Old Testament prophets, the "Kingdom" becomes a shapeless concept, useful for rhetoric but empty of concrete meaning.

<div class="peters-quote">
“The meanings usually given to this kingdom indicate that the most vague, indefinite notions exist concerning it. Theologians, eminent for their piety and position in the Church, are now entertaining crude ideas and contradictory conceptions of the kingdom.”
<br>— <em>Prop. 3, Intro</em>
</div>

He noted that this vagueness was not accidental, but a habit inherited from centuries of allegorical interpreters. By spiritualizing the text, theologians had effectively turned the "Kingdom" into a theological container for whatever concept they preferred at the moment. He traces this directly back to the influence of early allegorists like Origen and Clement of Alexandria, who <span class="kingdom-gold">prioritized hidden spiritual meanings over the plain text.</span>

<div class="peters-quote">
“For many centuries, under the interpretation given by men who have, probably unconsciously, largely imbibed the spirit of the Alexandrian school, the kingdom has been made to mean a variety of things at the option of the writer.”
<br>— <em>Prop. 3, Intro</em>
</div>

This "option of the writer" is the root of our modern crisis. It allows the interpreter to project their own cultural or theological context onto the Bible. Peters argued that when the plain grammatical sense is discarded, the text becomes a playground for "fancy," <span class="kingdom-gold">allowing philosophy to override prophecy:</span>

<div class="peters-quote">
“They engraft upon Holy Writ the deductions of Hegelian philosophy, and thus, through the great ability and learning cojoined, mislead the unwary reader... instead of discarding this looseness, [they] seem to revel in it, making the kingdom to denote almost everything that fancy connects with religion, or the Church, or even with humanity.”
<br>— <em>Prop. 3, Obs. 3</em>
</div>

This looseness allows even skeptics and rationalists to play with the term. Peters cites Renan and others who strip the Kingdom of divinity entirely, redefining it as "the reign of the poor," "the liberty of the soul," or "civilization viewed religiously." When the definition is loose, it becomes a "phantom" that anyone can claim.

### **The Contradictions: A Multiplication of Kingdoms**

One of Peters' strongest points is his exposure of the logical contradictions inherent in these spiritualized definitions. He dissected the popular commentaries of his day to show how the term "Kingdom" was being used to mean opposing things in the same commentary.

#### **The Confusion of Terms**

Peters dissected the commentary of Albert Barnes to illustrate this incoherence. In his analysis, he catalogs the various definitions Barnes assigns to the "Kingdom" across different passages, revealing a stark lack of consistency:

| Scriptural Reference | Corresponding Definition |
| :---- | :---- |
| Matthew 3:2 | "His spiritual reign begun in the Church on earth and completed in heaven" |
| Matthew 13:24 | "The gospel," or "the effect of the gospel" |
| Matthew 13:31 | "Piety in a renewed heart, or the Church" |
| Matthew 13:44 | "The gospel, the new dispensation, the offer of eternal life" |
| Matthew 25:34 | "Salvation," "eternal life," or "heaven" |
| Matthew 16:19 | "The Church on earth" |

These definitions are <span class="kingdom-gold">fundamentally contradictory</span> because they fail to observe critical scriptural distinctions. By treating the term as a flexible cipher, such interpretations collapse distinct theological categories: the proclamation concerning the Kingdom (the gospel) is confused with the reality of the Kingdom itself; the inhabitants who are to receive it (the heirs) are conflated with the reward they are promised (the inheritance). Peters cuts through this with devastating logic regarding the "heirs":

<div class="peters-quote">
“Surely the kingdom cannot possibly mean all these things, seeing that such explanations are both arbitrary and contradictory. The gospel of, or concerning, the kingdom is one fact, the kingdom itself is quite another; the dispensation in which the kingdom is to be manifested is certainly different from the kingdom which it embraces; the heirs of the kingdom are certainly not the inheritance.”
<br>— <em>Prop. 3, Obs. 1</em>
</div>

He applies similar scrutiny to theologians like Dr. Barrow, who defined the Kingdom as "the state or constitution of religion." Peters counters that if the Kingdom is merely a "state of religion," then the Old Testament saints (who certainly had a state of religion) must have been in the Kingdom, yet the New Testament speaks of it as future. He quotes Jeremy Taylor to highlight how men dignify their own inventions:

<div class="peters-quote">
“Men will call all opinions by the name of religion; and superstructures by the name of fundamental articles; and fancies by the glorious appellation of faith.”
<br>— <em>Prop. 3, Obs. 10</em>
</div>

Appellation of faith indeed. By failing to maintain clear, scriptural definitions, theologians create a fog of confusion where the Kingdom can mean anything and everything, leading to contradictions that undermine the very concept they seek to uphold. When, as we've briefly demonstrated in prior posts, the Kingdom was is very definite, covenanted, and concrete reality, expected by God's chosen people and preached by Christ Himself.

#### **The Multiplication of Realms**

Perhaps the most absurd consequence of spiritualizing the Kingdom is the sheer number of “Kingdoms” theologians are forced to invent in order to preserve their systems. Once the covenanted, Davidic Kingdom is set aside, and Israel is spiritualized into the Church, <span class="kingdom-gold">theology compensates by multiplying definitions, each tailored to explain away texts that no longer fit.</span>

Peters observed this tendency already in his own century. Scholars such as Neander were compelled to invent multiple kingdoms—an “invisible kingdom in the Church,” a “visible kingdom in the Church,” and even a “kingdom in the person of Christ.” Dr. Lange went further, dividing the Kingdom into the “kingdom of power,” the “kingdom of grace,” and the “kingdom of glory,” only to subdivide each of those again. The result was not clarity, but escalation.

What follows is not an exaggeration but a representative sample of how leading theologians, many of whom Peters admired, were forced to redefine and multiply the Kingdom once its original covenantal meaning was abandoned:

This proliferation is not accidental. <span class="kingdom-gold">Each additional “kingdom” exists to solve a theological problem created by spiritualizing the text.</span> Instead of allowing Scripture to define the Kingdom, these systems redefine the Kingdom to protect their conclusions—substituting abstractions, processes, and stages for a single promised reign.

Peters’ assessment is devastating precisely because it is so restrained:

<div class="peters-quote"> “These are purely theological deductions, having no foundation whatever in Scripture... Like preceding definitions, it lowers the theocracy by denying to it the reality of being in all respects the kingdom of God. This alone should cause us to receive it with grave doubts.” <br>— <em>Prop. 3, Obs. 4</em> </div>

### **The Chronological Chaos**

If the *nature* of the Kingdom is confused, the *timing* is even worse. Peters points out that because theologians have abandoned the specific Davidic restoration, they cannot agree on when the Kingdom began.

<div class="peters-quote">
“Those who give us such definitions, antagonistic to the primitive Church view, exhibit also the greatest diversity among themselves respecting the commencement of this kingdom in its supposed present form. They are as little agreed concerning its beginning as in its meaning.”
<br>— <em>Prop. 3, Obs. 8</em>
</div>

A direct symptom of these vague definitions is the profound lack of consensus on when the Kingdom actually began. Theologians have proposed numerous, conflicting start dates, including:

*   In Paradise
*   After the Fall
*   At the establishment of the Theocracy at Sinai
*   With the preaching of John the Baptist
*   At the birth, baptism, or death of Christ
*   On the day of Pentecost
*   At the destruction of Jerusalem

This radical disagreement on a point as fundamental as the Kingdom's inauguration is presented not merely as scholarly debate, but as dispositive proof that the modern definitions are fatally flawed, arising from a non-scriptural "felt need to locate a presently existing kingdom."

He asks a piercing question regarding this uncertainty:

<div class="peters-quote">
“Is it not remarkable that a kingdom of God, so distinctively covenanted and predicted, should be so indefinite in its commencement that eminent and pious men are unable to point out its beginning with any degree of absolute certainty?”
<br>— <em>Prop. 3, Obs. 8</em>
</div>

He highlights the contradiction between those who say the Kingdom has been continuous throughout history and those who admit the New Testament presents it as something "new." The spiritualizing method leaves us with a Kingdom that is <span class="kingdom-gold">everywhere and nowhere</span>, eternal and yet "at hand," creating a fog that obscures the clear timeline of prophecy.

### Conclusion: A Fog of Our Own Making

What Peters uncovered in his own century is exactly what we still face: once the clear, covenanted, Davidic Kingdom is reinterpreted, spiritualized, or abstracted, everything else begins to wobble. The definitions multiply, the timelines blur, and the “Kingdom” becomes whatever the interpreter needs it to be. Instead of a concrete, promised government rooted in Scripture, we inherit a cloud of competing metaphors, each claiming the same name but pointing in wildly different directions.

The result is not merely academic confusion—it is a loss of theological coherence. When the Kingdom becomes subjective, elastic, or symbolic, the promises attached to it lose their weight, and our hope becomes as foggy as our definitions.

If this was the state of things in Peters’ time, what happened when the 20th and 21st centuries arrived with new philosophies, new politics, new movements, and new theological agendas?

In Part 2, we follow Peters’ warning into the modern world—and watch how the fog thickened, fractured, and spread even further.
