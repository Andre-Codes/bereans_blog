In [Part 1](/2025/12/12/kingdom-fog-part-1/), we established G.N.H. Peters' core critique: when the "Kingdom of God" is severed from its literal Davidic roots, it becomes a "wax nose," capable of being shaped into any form the interpreter desires. Peters predicted that this <span class="kingdom-gold">abandonment of the covenanted definition</span> would lead to a "vague" and "indefinite" theology where the Kingdom means everything and nothing.

The "antagonism" Peters predicted in 1884 is now our reality. In our analysis of modern theology, we find that his warning has come to pass with startling accuracy. The definitions have not converged; they have fractured further. Because the literal definition was abandoned, the 20th and 21st centuries saw the "Kingdom" redefined to suit every emerging philosophical trend, resulting in a landscape of disconnected and contrived meanings.

### **The Modern Divergences: A Survey of Chaos**

The theological landscape of the last century is characterized by a profound <span class="kingdom-gold">semantic deregulation</span>. The Kingdom has transformed from a *destination* (a covenanted empire to come) into a *process* (a moral, political, or evolutionary trajectory). We can categorize the modern "fog" into several distinct divergences, each proving Peters' thesis that without the Davidic root, the Kingdom becomes a vessel for the theologian's own context.

#### **1. The Ecclesiastical Divergence: The Kingdom as Institution**

Just as Peters critiqued those who made the Kingdom "the Church on earth," modern theology has codified this identification in mutually exclusive ways. The sheer variety of "institutional" definitions demonstrates the contrived nature of these interpretations.

* **Roman Catholicism (The Sacramental Kingdom):** The Second Vatican Council’s *Lumen Gentium* defines the Church as the "Kingdom of Christ now present in mystery." Here, the Kingdom is a sacramental reality that "grows visibly" through the Church's work.[^1] It is an organic, mystery-filled expansion of the ecclesiastical hierarchy.  
* **Reformed Theology (The Invisible Kingdom):** In stark contrast to the visible Catholic hierarchy, Louis Berkhof defines the Kingdom as the "invisible Church"—the rule of God established in the hearts of the elect.[^2] Here, the "throne of David" is not an earthly chair or a visible institution, but a spiritual "sphere" of salvation found only in the regenerate heart.  
* **LDS Restorationism (The Corporate Kingdom):** Moving to a startling "structural literalism," Lawrence E. Corbridge of the LDS Church asserts, "The kingdom of God is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."[^3] Here, the Kingdom is neither a mystery nor an invisible concept, but a specific American corporate entity with a defined bureaucracy.

**The Contradiction:** One cannot reconcile a Kingdom that *is* the Roman hierarchy with a Kingdom that *is* the invisible elect, nor with one that *is* the LDS corporation. They are <span class="kingdom-gold">fundamentally different geometries</span> claiming the same biblical title—a "disconnected" landscape where the term "Kingdom" is applied to whatever structure the theologian wishes to validate.

#### **2. The Sociopolitical Divergence: The Kingdom as Justice**

If the ecclesiastical view confines the Kingdom to the Church, the sociopolitical view dissolves it into the world. This stream redefines the Kingdom as a program of social ethics or political liberation.

* **The Social Gospel (State-Building):** Walter Rauschenbusch defined the Kingdom as "humanity organized according to the will of God."[^4] It became a "progressive reign of love" achieved through socialist economic reform and the "Christianizing" of the social order.  
* **Liberation Theology (State-Overthrowing):** Gustavo Gutiérrez radicalized this, defining the Kingdom as the "process of liberation" from oppression.[^5] James Cone further defined it as "the victory of the victims over their victimizers," framing the Kingdom as a counter-hegemonic power struggle.[^6]  
* **Christian Anarchism (State-Rejecting):** Conversely, Leo Tolstoy defined the Kingdom as the *rejection* of all government and authority (including Church and State) in favor of the internal law of love. For Tolstoy, the Kingdom is "within you"—meaning it is the abolition of external law.[^7]

**The Contradiction:** Here, the Kingdom is simultaneously a government program (Rauschenbusch) and the rejection of government (Tolstoy). It is a political revolution (Gutiérrez) and a pacifist withdrawal. Without the anchor of the Davidic Theocracy, the "Kingdom" becomes a <span class="kingdom-gold">synonym for whatever political ideology</span> the interpreter prefers.

#### **3. The Mystical and Evolutionary Divergence: The Kingdom as Process**

A third stream interiorizes the Kingdom into consciousness or biology, stripping it of both political and ecclesiastical structure.

* **Evolutionary Theology:** Pierre Teilhard de Chardin viewed the Kingdom as a "prodigious biological operation"—the evolution of the universe toward the "Omega Point" of complexity.[^8] The Kingdom becomes a property of physics and biology rather than a covenantal promise.  
* **Liberal Progressivism:** Bishop John Shelby Spong stripped the Kingdom of theism entirely, defining it as a symbol for the "fullness of humanity" and "self-actualization."[^9] The Kingdom is not a place, but a "state of life."  
* **Spiritual Formation:** Dallas Willard defined the Kingdom as "the range of God's effective will," privatizing it into a sphere of personal obedience.[^10] While pastorally potent, this definition effectively de-politicizes the concept, turning the Kingdom from a geopolitical reality into a metaphysical space available to the individual mystic.

After surveying these wildly different trajectories—some ecclesiastical, some political, some mystical—the reader begins to feel what Peters himself felt more than a century ago: a doctrine stretched until it tears. He saw the same tendency in his own era, a relentless pressure to make the Kingdom validate whatever movement, institution, or ideology a group wished to justify.

<div class="peters-quote"> “Indeed, no doctrine of the Bible has fared so badly through mere fancy, imagination, enthusiasm, and fanaticism as that of the kingdom. In behalf of a theory or system it has been perverted, distorted, and abused until many persons, looking only at the abuses and antagonism (forgetting that all truth is subject to the same), discard the whole matter. When the Papacy, Shakers, Mormons, etc. define it in a way to embrace their particular organizations; when Anabaptists, Fifth Monarchy men, etc. interpret it so as to include their ambitious projects; when almost every denomination, sect, etc. explain it so as to make themselves the recipients of the kingdom; when it has been prostituted to the basest of purposes, and it is presented in a hundred different aspects and claims—all this only shows how important these parties consider the incorporation and possession in some form, of the doctrine. It is amazing to a person who steadily for years notices the definitions of others, how latitudinarian they have become in these modern days.” <br>— <em>Prop. 3, Obs. 7</em> </div>

That tendency didn’t die with the eccentric movements of the 1800s. It just morphed. Unfortunately, modern theology didn’t dodge the problem, it amplified it.


### **The Contemporary Consensus: "Reign, Not Realm"**

In an attempt to navigate this chaos, mainstream evangelicalism has largely settled on a "Dynamic" definition: the Kingdom is God's *reign* (power), not His *realm* (place). While this avoids the extremes of liberalism, it still leaves the definition abstract enough to mean different things to different teachers.

Even the most respected modern theologians offer definitions that, while pious, lack the specific "covenanted" parameters Peters insisted upon. Note the shift in the table below from "Territory/Nation" to "Reign/Influence/Rule."

| Theologian / Thinker | Core Definition of the Kingdom | Key Emphasis | Raw Source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **John Piper** | The kingdom of God is **God’s reign**, specifically His *saving reign* exercised through Christ—present now and fully consummated in the future. | Sovereign rule; salvation; already/not yet | Desiring God, “What Is the Kingdom of God?” |
| **Tim Keller** | The kingdom is **God’s sovereign rule breaking into the world**, renewing not just individual hearts but *all of creation*. Not escape from the world, but restoration of it. | Cosmic renewal; reign over all reality | *Center Church*; Redeemer City to City lectures |
| **George Eldon Ladd** | The kingdom is **God’s dynamic reign**, inaugurated in Jesus’ ministry but awaiting future consummation; both present and future. | Inaugurated eschatology; reign before realm | *The Presence of the Future* |
| **N. T. Wright** | The kingdom is **God becoming king on earth as in heaven**, inaugurating new creation through Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection. | New creation; historical inbreaking | “The Gospel and the Kingdom of God,” NTWrightOnline |
| **D. A. Carson** | The kingdom primarily denotes **the reign of God**, particularly the *saving reign* under which reconciliation and life are found—not merely a territory or institution. | Reign over realm; biblical precision | Carson essays & interviews (e.g., Patheos, TGC) |
| **Christopher W. Morgan** | The kingdom is **God’s rule over His people in His creation**, present through Christ and awaiting final fulfillment. | Rule + people + creation | The Gospel Coalition, “The Kingdom of God” |
| **Patrick Schreiner** | The kingdom is **the King’s power over His people in His place**, inaugurated in Christ and consummated at His return. | King–people–place framework | *The Kingdom of God and the Glory of the Cross*; TGC |
| **Tim Challies** | The kingdom is **God’s reign to which believers submit**, shaping obedience, repentance, and allegiance to Christ as King. | Practical submission to divine rule | Challies.com; TGC articles |

### **The Psychological Barrier: Why We Stay in the Fog**

Why do theologians persist in these vague definitions? Peters offers a profound psychological insight into the human tendency to prefer comfortable error over difficult truth. He reminds us of the "fallibility of the most powerful mind" and our proneness to arrogate to ourselves the right to construct meaning rather than submit to the "plain, grammatical language" of God.

But the deeper reason is fear. We fear that investigating the foundations of our cherished beliefs might prove them sandy. We prefer the comfort of tradition to the disruption of truth.

<div class="peters-quote">
“Many shrink from investigation when they find that things which they fondly believed, incorporated in their prayers and hopes, and portrayed with eloquence, are subject to the suspicion of being built upon a sandy foundation... This may indeed be an amiable weakness, but it is one as fatal to the student as Delilah’s hands were to Samson.”
<br>— <em>Prop. 3, Obs. 14</em>
</div>

This "amiable weakness" blinds us. We are comfortable with the "friendly" error of a spiritualized Kingdom that validates our current church programs. We are less comfortable with the "adversary" of a literal Kingdom that declares our current efforts insufficient and points to a future Divine intervention. As Peters warns:

<div class="peters-quote">
“Error, too, is often plausible and friendly; truth sometimes comes in the garb of an adversary.”
<br>— <em>Prop. 3, Obs. 13</em>
</div>

### **Conclusion: The Cost of "Fancy"**

The result of this theological fluidity is that the "Kingdom of God" ceases to be a specific promise of God and becomes a <span class="kingdom-gold">mirror of human desire</span>. It robs the believer of a concrete hope. Instead of looking for a real King who will solve the problems of governance, justice, and peace, the believer is left looking at the Church, or society, or their own heart—all of which are failing.

If the Kingdom is Rauschenbusch’s social order, it failed in World War I. If it is Harnack’s inner peace, it fails every time we are anxious. If it is the Church, it fails every time the hierarchy falls into scandal.

Peters understood that God’s covenant was not a metaphor. He prescribes the only remedy: "adopt legitimate principles of interpretation" and "never to depart from the same." We must return to the "simplicity and unity of the Word."

<div class="peters-quote">
“The Kingdom is not a pious movement, a religious association, or an internal feeling... The Kingdom is a government... designed to rule over all the earth.”
<br>— <em>Prop. 3 (Summary)</em>
</div>

When we spiritualize the prophecies, we do not deepen their meaning; we destroy their precision. We are left with a vocabulary that sounds biblical but lacks biblical substance. To recover the Kingdom, we must recover the integrity of the Covenants.
