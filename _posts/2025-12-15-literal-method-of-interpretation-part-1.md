If Scripture were as clear as many assume, there would not be such radically different conceptions of the Kingdom of God, prophecy, and eschatology—each claiming biblical warrant, yet contradicting one another at nearly every major point.

The problem, G. N. H. Peters argues, is not that Scripture is obscure. The problem is that its <span class="kingdom-gold">plain meaning has been systematically displaced</span>.

In *Proposition 4* of *The Theocratic Kingdom*, Peters addresses the issue that lies beneath every disagreement about the Kingdom: **how language itself is to be understood**. His claim is straightforward, but its implications are immense:

<div class="proposition">
  <span class="prop-title">Prop. 4</span>
“The literal, grammatical interpretation of the Scriptures must (connected with the figurative, tropical, or rhetorical) be observed in order to obtain a correct understanding of this kingdom.”
</div>

Before debating *what* the Kingdom is, Peters insists we must settle *how* God speaks.

## The Confusion of Tongues

Theological confusion rarely announces itself as rebellion. More often, it presents itself as sophistication.

Peters observed that many interpreters, dissatisfied with the Bible’s plain statements—especially concerning the Kingdom—introduced a second layer of meaning: a “spiritual,” “mystical,” or “higher” sense said to lie beneath the words. The result was not clarity, but chaos.

What begins as reverence for spiritual depth ends as a quiet abandonment of grammatical meaning.

Bernard Ramm, writing from a different century but addressing the same crisis, framed the issue sharply: hermeneutics exists because **God has spoken**, and therefore meaning must be discovered, not invented. The fundamental question is not whether Scripture is inspired, but whether it is *intelligible* .

## Defining Our Terms

Few words generate more resistance than *literal*. Peters knew this, and so did Ramm. Both therefore go out of their way to clarify what the term does—and does not—mean.

### What “Literal” Does *Not* Mean

Peters explicitly rejects crude literalism:

<div class="peters-quote" markdown="1">
“When employing the word ‘literal,’ we are to be comprehended as also fully acknowledging the figurative sense, the beautiful ornaments of language; we cordially accept all that is natural to language itself… but object to additionally forcing on it a foreign element.”
</div>

Figures of speech are not enemies of literal interpretation; they are part of it. Metaphor, symbol, and type are governed by rules just as much as prose.

Ramm makes the same clarification, explicitly dismantling the caricature that “literal” means rigid or unimaginative reading:

> “The program of the literal interpretation of Scripture does not overlook the figures of speech, the symbols, the types, the allegories that as a matter of fact are to be found in Holy Scripture. It is not a blind letterism nor a wooden literalism as is so often the accusation.” — *Bernard Ramm, <span style="font-style:italic;">Protestant Biblical Interpretation</span>*

### What “Literal” *Does* Mean

By *literal*, Peters means **grammatical interpretation**—language understood according to the normal rules by which language communicates meaning:

<div class="peters-quote" markdown="1">
“Some writers… have employed the phrase ‘literal interpretation,’ by which they denote… that the language of the Bible is to be interpreted by the customary rules of grammar and rhetoric, which are used in determining the sense of the *Iliad*, *Paradise Lost*, and works of human composition.”
</div>

Ramm echoes the same point, noting that “literal” is often misunderstood as “letterism,” when it actually refers to the **normal sense of language as used by its authors and first hearers** . The Bible is unique in *content*, not in *grammar*.

To deny this is to suggest that Scripture alone operates under a different set of linguistic laws—a claim neither Scripture nor reason supports.

---

## The “Good Faith” Argument

At the heart of Peters’ defense lies a moral claim about God Himself.

If God intended to make His will known, then He must communicate in a way that can be understood. Anything else would be deception.

<div class="peters-quote" markdown="1">
“If God has really intended to make known His will to man, it follows that… He must convey His truth to us in accordance with the well-known rules of language… instead of seeking a sense which the words in themselves do not contain.”
</div>

The alternative is devastating. If the true meaning of Scripture lies hidden beneath the words—accessible only through special insight, ecclesiastical authority, or mystical illumination—then the Bible ceases to be revelation and becomes a riddle.

Peters states the consequence without softening it:

<div class="peters-quote">
“If the Word is at the mercy of the interpreter, then the Bible is no longer a revelation, but a concealment of God’s will.”
</div>

Ramm presses the same point:

> “The only adequate method to unlock the meaning of Sacred Writ is the literal method. All other methods obscure the sense and permit the reader to read into the Scripture whatever he pleases.” — *Bernard Ramm, <span style="font-style:italic;">Protestant Biblical Interpretation</span>*

Without a stable grammatical meaning, interpretation becomes substitution.

---

## The Safety of the Literal Method

The grammatical approach does not impoverish Scripture; it protects it.

Without it, language becomes what later writers famously called a “wax nose”—twisted into whatever shape the interpreter desires. Peters warns that abandoning the grammatical sense opens the floodgates:

<div class="peters-quote" markdown="1">
“It effectually closes the door to a flood of wild and antagonistic interpretations fastened on the Word under the claim of superior spiritual enlightenment.”
</div>

This is not theoretical. Peters surveys centuries of theological history and finds that once interpreters permit an added “spiritual sense,” disagreement becomes unbounded. Every reader becomes his own authority.

Ramm makes explicit what this means in practice:

> “To rest one’s theology on the secondary strata of meanings is to invite interpretation by imagination. That which supplies the imagination with its content is unfortunately too often non-Biblical ideas or materials. The only sure way to know the meaning of Holy Scripture is to anchor interpretation in literal exegesis.” — *Bernard Ramm, <span style="font-style:italic;">Protestant Biblical Interpretation</span>*

Once an added sense is allowed, there is no principled way to stop its multiplication.

Before surveying *who* affirms this method, it is worth asking *what this method actually secures*.

Peters does not defend literal interpretation as a preference for his Kingdom arguments, but as a structural necessity—one that preserves revelation, coherence, and promise.

## The Question of Consensus

At this point, the objection often shifts.

The issue is no longer whether grammatical interpretation *works*, but whether it is isolated or "fringe".

Peters anticipated this objection and addressed it directly. His claim is striking:  
<span class="kingdom-gold">the literal–grammatical method is not disputed in principle—it is admitted across traditions, eras, and theological camps.</span>

What differs is not what interpreters *confess*, but what they consistently *apply*.

### Who Affirms the Literal–Grammatical Method

| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Biblical Introductions & Study Aids   | Horne, Alford, Dunn, Smith, Herzog             | Literal sense is *fundamental* to understanding Scripture | Often abandoned in prophecy          |
| Protestant Theologians & Commentators | Kitto, Fairbairn, Kurtz, Systematic Theologies | Literal sense is strongest doctrinal proof                | Spiritualize when inconvenient       |
| Reformers                             | Luther, Calvin (via Mosheim, Hallam)           | Confined themselves largely to literal interpretation     | Failed to reapply it to prophecy     |
| Roman Catholic Scholars               | John Gerson (via Neander)                      | Literal sense is the only true sense                      | Subordinated it to Church authority  |
| Exegetes & Hermeneuticians            | Ernesti, Michaelis                             | Same rules as classical literature                        | Neglected unity of divine plan       |
| Prophecy Scholars                     | Newton, Faber, Keith, Hurd                     | Literal interpretation required for prophecy              | —                                    |
| Pastors & Critics of Allegory         | Greswell, Graff                                | Words mean what they plainly say                          | Warned against multiple senses       |
{: .compact-table}

Peters draws a sharp conclusion from this pattern.

The issue is not ignorance, nor lack of scholarly consensus. It is inconsistency.

<div class="peters-quote" markdown="1">
“Our position is endorsed, at least in theory if not always in practice, by the ablest writers… Indeed, the plain grammatico-rhetorical sense is to multitudes the end of controversy.”
</div>

He presses the point further, noting that even those most inclined toward spiritualizing instinctively rely on the literal sense when it supports them:

<div class="peters-quote" markdown="1">
“It is self-evident that… in the interpretation of Scripture they are correct and truthful in proportion as the literal sense or the natural figurative one sustains them.”
</div>

In other words, the literal sense is not rejected because it is unworkable, but because it proves inconvenient.


## A Book for All Men

If Scripture can only be rightly understood by the learned, the initiated, or the mystically gifted, then it was never truly given to *all*.

<div class="peters-quote" markdown="1">
“Chillingworth affirms our view, because God designed His Word not simply ‘for the learned, but for all men,’ which design is only met by the grammatical sense.”
</div>

The literal method does not flatten Scripture; it allows access to it.  
<span class="kingdom-gold"> It allows the unlearned believer, reading attentively and reverently, to grasp the same promises God intended when He first spoke them.</span>

Ramm captures this responsibility succinctly:

> “It is the interpreter’s responsibility to guard the use of Holy Scripture by the hedge of literal exegesis.” — *Bernard Ramm, <span style="font-style:italic;">Protestant Biblical Interpretation</span>*

In the next post, we will turn from definition to history—examining how the Church moved away from this method, how allegory entered through the back door, and why appeals to “the Spirit” and “the letter kills” fail under careful examination.
