*Series: The Kingdom Announcement • Part 3*

If the first post entered the world of the first-century Jew to hear the announcement, and the second examined the controversy created by later reinterpretations, this third post turns to the positive theological reality: <span class="kingdom-gold">what the kingdom meant to the people who heard it first.</span>

John’s audience understood the kingdom because they understood the Old Testament. Jesus’ disciples understood the kingdom because He preached it in the same terms. Mary, Zechariah, the prophets, the apostles, and the earliest church all shared a unified expectation—one rooted in covenant, prophecy, and the literal promises of God.

And this expectation appears with startling clarity in the **phraseology** itself.

---

# **The Phraseology**

When the Jews heard John use the word *kingdom,* they would have done what Dr. Andrew Woods insists all interpreters must do:

> “…not define it by their favorite theological system, but rather… define it by the Old Testament.”

This is the unavoidable starting point.

George Peters explains in Proposition 22 that the language Jesus and John employed was **not new**, not reinterpreted, and not adjusted. It was the full, inherited vocabulary of Old Testament expectation:

<div class="peters-quote" markdown="1">
“First is to be found the well-known expectations of the Jews based on a literal interpretation of the prophecies; next, these are summed up in the expressive phrases ‘Kingdom of heaven,’ etc., taken, as numerous writers inform us, from Daniel 7:13-14; finally, John, Jesus, and others take the very phraseology adopted by the Jews to designate a certain definite Kingdom, and use it **without the slightest intimation or explanation of a change in its meaning;** and this employment of the phrases, with a correspondent Jewish meaning attached, continued… at least down (Acts 1:6) to the ascension of Christ.”
<br>— <em>Prop. 22, Obs. 1</em>
</div>

Peters then cites even those who **reject** literal interpretation but still admit the force of the language:

<div class="peters-quote">
“There is reason to believe not only that the expression ‘Kingdom of heaven,’ as used in the N. T., was employed as synonymous with ‘Kingdom of God,’ as referred to in the Old Testament, but that the former expression had become common among the Jews of our Lord’s time for denoting the state of things expected to be brought in by the Messiah. The mere use of the expression as it first occurs in Matthew, uttered apparently by John the Baptist and our Lord Himself, *without a note of explanation,* as if all perfectly understood what was meant by it, seems alone conclusive evidence of this.”
<br>— <em>Prop. 22, Intro</em>
</div>

The conclusion is plain enough: <span class="kingdom-gold">the kingdom Jesus announced was the same kingdom the prophets described and the same kingdom the Jews awaited.</span>

# **Defining the Kingdom by the Old Testament**

Dr. Andrew Woods presses a simple but decisive point:

> “So what do you have in Matthew 3:2? You just have the word ‘Kingdom’ and it’s not defined. So I’m not free to pour into that word another definition. What I am obligated under God to do is to search the Old Testament and figure out how prior revelation defines that term; *it is the geo-political and spiritual rule of Christ manifested on planet earth*… and you see, the amillennial system… completely pours a bunch of meaning in that word Kingdom that you’re not going to find anywhere in the Old Testament.”

Woods’ point is hermeneutically airtight:
<span class="kingdom-gold">If Jesus does not redefine the term, the Old Testament remains the authoritative dictionary.</span>

# **A Thought Experiment: Hearing the Announcement as a First-Century Jew**

Imagine being transported back into that moment. You possess no New Testament. You have only:

* Daniel’s vision of the Son of Man receiving dominion
* Isaiah’s royal child ruling with justice
* Jeremiah’s Branch restoring David’s line
* Zechariah’s promised King coming and reigning
* The covenant guarantees to Abraham and David

Then John appears, fulfilling Isaiah 40:3 and Malachi 3:1, announcing:

<span class="scripture">“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”</span>

How would you define *kingdom*?

You would define it exactly as your Scriptures had taught you:

* a restored kingdom to Israel
* ruled by the Messiah
* from David’s throne
* on earth
* in fulfillment of covenant promises

This expectation forms the backbone of the entire New Testament narrative.

---

# **Implications of the Announcement**

Woods simplifies the force of the preaching into plain-language paraphrase:

> “…what is being said here by, ‘repent for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand’ is that the unchallenged rulership of God in heaven has the potential of manifesting itself to the earth as Jesus rules this planet of sinners with a rod of iron, where His will will never be second-guessed. And to get it, Israel, all you have to do is fulfill your condition, because, genealogically the guy you’ve been waiting for is here, just enthrone Him on His terms and the Kingdom will come. Because, Israel, once you do that you will not just be the owner but the possessor, the covenant structure will be satisfied, and the Kingdom will come.”

Everything about the announcement is **Davidic** in orientation.

Everything.

This is why Matthew begins his Gospel with a genealogy centered on David:

<span class="scripture">“The record of the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham…”</span>

Matthew structures the genealogy to highlight that Jesus is:

* the promised Son of David
* heir to the throne
* fulfillment of 2 Samuel 7
* continuation of the Abrahamic line

The structure itself is a theological argument:
<span class="kingdom-gold">Jesus is the King of the promised kingdom.</span>

# **Mary and Zechariah: The First Two Witnesses of the Kingdom**

Before John or Jesus ever preach, Mary and Zechariah give Spirit-filled interpretations of the events unfolding around them.

### **The Angel’s Announcement to Mary**

<span class="scripture">“He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David, and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end.”</span>
<span class="scripture">-Luke 1:32–33</span>

No spiritualizing.
No redefinition.
No hint that the throne is heavenly or figurative.

### **Zechariah’s Prophecy**

<span class="scripture">**68 “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,
For He has visited us and accomplished redemption for His people,
69 And has raised up a horn of salvation for us
In the house of His servant David—
70 Just as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from ancient times—
71 Salvation from our enemies,
And from the hand of all who hate us;
72 To show mercy to our fathers,
And to remember His holy covenant,
73 The oath which He swore to our father Abraham,
74 To grant us that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies,
Would serve Him without fear,
75 In holiness and righteousness before Him all our days.
76 And you, child, also will be called the prophet of the Most High;
For you will go on before the Lord to prepare His ways;
77 To give His people the knowledge of salvation
By the forgiveness of their sins,
78 Because of the tender mercy of our God,
With which the Sunrise from on high will visit us,
79 To shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death,
To guide our feet into the way of peace.”**</span>

Zechariah’s prophecy overflows with covenant language:

* the Davidic covenant (vv. 69–70)
* the Abrahamic oath (vv. 72–73)
* national deliverance (vv. 71, 74)
* restoration and righteousness (v. 75)

This is not symbolic spirituality.
This is **kingdom expectation**, exactly as the prophets promised.

Peters reflects on the impossibility of God “redefining” such promises:

<div class="peters-quote">
“if David’s throne and kingdom is not David’s throne and kingdom as the words indicate, and as fondly believed in for centuries, but is, as men in their wisdom afterward developed, the Father’s throne in heaven and the Father’s Kingdom on earth and in heaven, how then can we reconcile it with God’s own assurances of veracity, desire to instruct, undeviating truthfulness, etc., that He would clothe His own gracious and merciful words in a dress calculated to deceive, and which did beguile the Jews and Primitive Christians, His children, into a false faith and hope. No! never, never can we receive any theory, however plausibly and learnedly presented, which thus reflects on God’s goodness, makes Him virtually a party to gross deception, and which degrades the intelligence and piety of former saints. Who can censure us for believing in a sense so generally admitted as given by God Himself, placing ourselves where prophets, pious Jews, and the early Christians stood? Having thus in the outset a vantage ground, needing not to prove what multitudes already concede, let us lay aside our “worldly wisdom,” and in a childlike disposition for instruction, follow this grammatical interpretation, carefully gathering up the detached portions, and see where it will lead us. It will reveal a strangeness most surprising, a sublimity most inspiring, and a beauty most delightful, in God’s work.”
</div>

This is one of the most forceful arguments in the entire work.

# **Walvoord’s Reinforcement of Davidic Literalism**

John Walvoord, commenting on the Davidic covenant, confirms the same point:

> “In this and other Old Testament references there is no allusion anywhere to the idea that these promises are to be understood in a spiritualized sense as referring to the church or to a reign of God in heaven. Rather, it is linked to the earth and to the seed of Israel, and to the land… Such a situation does not prevail in this present age and is not related here or elsewhere to the reign of Christ from the throne of His Father in heaven rather than the throne of David on earth.”

This expectation is not fringe. It is the unified witness of:

* the prophets
* the covenants
* Mary
* Zechariah
* John
* Jesus
* the apostles
* the early Church

# **The Announcement in Jesus’ Ministry and the Sending of the Twelve and the Seventy**

J. Dwight Pentecost summarizes the chain of kingdom announcements:

> “Jesus Christ, both in His own ministry and in that ministry committed to the disciples, announced the fact that the theocratic kingdom was at hand… In sending out the twelve, Jesus commissioned them to preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand’ (Matt. 10:7). The seventy are sent forth and the command is given: ‘say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.’ (Luke 10:9,11)… By the term ‘At hand’ the announcement is being made that the kingdom is to be expected imminently…”

If the disciples were fundamentally mistaken about the nature of the kingdom, this entire missionary strategy becomes unintelligible.

Peters captures the absurdity:

<div class="peters-quote">
“Why does not John and the disciples first receive preliminary counsel, so that, themselves freed from alleged error, they may properly teach others respecting the Kingdom? …No other explanation will cover the facts in the case.”
</div>

If Jesus intended to establish a spiritual kingdom, it is inconceivable that He would send out messengers who misunderstood the very thing they were preaching.

# **The Disciples’ Expectation: Not Corrected, but Confirmed**

Right up to the ascension—*after* 40 days of kingdom instruction—the disciples ask:

<span class="scripture">“Lord, is it at this time You are restoring the kingdom to Israel?”</span>
<span class="scripture">-Acts 1:6</span>

Jesus does not correct their understanding of what the kingdom **is**.
He only corrects their understanding of <span class="kingdom-gold">the timing</span>.

---

# **Conclusion: The Framework That Makes Sense of Everything**

The only framework that fits every detail of the announcement, every expectation of the Jews, every covenant promise, and every prophetic utterance is:

1. **The Old Testament defined the kingdom literally.**
2. **The Jews expected that literal kingdom.**
3. **John and Jesus preached that same kingdom.**
4. **Mary and Zechariah celebrated its literal fulfillment.**
5. **Jesus never redefined the kingdom or corrected the expectation.**
6. **Israel’s rejection postponed—not transformed—the kingdom.**
7. **The future messianic kingdom still awaits literal fulfillment.**

This brings us to the natural next step in the series:

### **What *exactly* did first-century Jews expect the kingdom to be?

What were its features, contours, promises, and prophetic anchors?
And how does that expectation illuminate every moment of Jesus’ ministry?**

That exploration—rooted in the Davidic covenant and the prophetic books—forms the heart of what comes next.
