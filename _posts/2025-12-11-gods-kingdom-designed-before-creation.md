In the study of eschatology and the Divine Plan, few concepts are as stabilizing and awe-inspiring as the realization that God’s Kingdom is not a reaction to history, but the very reason for history. In his monumental work, *The Theocratic Kingdom*, G.N.H. Peters lays out a profound proposition that shifts our eyes from the chaos of the present to the unshakeable intent of the past.

<div class="proposition">
  <span class="prop-title">Prop. 2</span>
  “The establishment of this kingdom was determined before, and designed and prepared from, the foundation of the world.”
</div>

This truth anchors the believer in the reality that the Kingdom was the <span class="kingdom-gold">original blueprint in the mind of the Creator</span>. As Peters notes, the Scriptures reveal that “the Divine purpose relating to the kingdom existed in the mind of the Eternal before the creation of the world” (Matthew 25:34, John 17:24, Ephesians 1:4, Hebrews 4:3, 1 Peter 1:20, Revelation 13:8).

Here are key insights regarding this eternal design, drawn directly from Peters’ work.

### **Creation Was Preparatory for the Kingdom**

We often view creation as a separate event from the Kingdom, but Peters argues they are inextricably linked. The physical world was not an accident; it was the intended stage for God’s glory.

<div class="peters-quote">
“In the mind of the Divine Architect and Purposer, the contemplated final use of this world was allied with its origin”
<br>— <em>Prop. 2, Obs. 1</em>
</div>

Critics may mock the biblical language of the “foundations of the earth,” but Peters reminds us that “the general analogy of the Scriptures teach that these are in the creative power, wisdom, love—the attributes—of the Creator” (Job 26:7).

We can properly infer the dignity of this subject, for it is “comprehended in the eternal counsels and evolved from the ever-existing ‘purpose of Him, which worketh all things after the counsel of His own will.’”

### **The Kingdom Belongs to the Earth**

One of the most vital distinctions in *The Theocratic Kingdom* is the location of this Kingdom. It is not merely a spiritual abstraction, but a <span class="kingdom-gold">physical reality tied to this planet</span>. Indeed, “The exercise of creative power, and its continued exhibition in behalf of man and the world, clearly shows the Divine determination to establish this kingdom.”

This is not a distant reality; rather:

<div class="peters-quote">
“This kingdom is one pertaining to the earth... ‘From the foundation of the world’ is indicative that God purposed this very earth, when founded, for this kingdom.”
<br>— <em>Prop. 2, Obs. 2</em>
</div>

While the Fall introduced antagonistic elements, the original purpose remains. Peters argues that while unbelief views nature as an end in itself, the doctrine of the Kingdom proposes “a renewal, a deliverance, a restitution, which shall free nature, exalt man, and glorify the Maker” (Ephesians 1:4, 1 Peter 1:20).

### **A Restitution of What Was Marred**

Because the Kingdom was designed before the Fall, the current state of the world is not final. The curse must be reversed to match the original blueprint.

<div class="peters-quote">
“Such phraseology involves, of necessity, owing to the fall and entailed curse, a glorious restitution for which provision is to be made... it is requisite, before God’s purpose is fully carried out, to restore that forfeited perfection.”
<br>— <em>Prop. 2, Obs. 3</em>
</div>

### **The King and His Rulers Were Preordained**

The Kingdom implies a King and a government. This was not an afterthought.

<div class="peters-quote">
“This phraseology respecting the kingdom includes, in view of expressed predetermination, the appointment or preordination of the king”
<br>— <em>Prop. 2, Obs. 4</em>
</div>

Furthermore, it includes the rulers:

<div class="peters-quote">
“It also comprehends the number of the rulers, elect, heirs or inheritors of the kingdom... as well as every particular, provisionary and realized, pertaining to it”
<br>— <em>Prop. 2, Obs. 5</em>
</div>

### **History and Time Are Ordered for the Kingdom**

Why has history unfolded in this specific way? Peters suggests that the very ages are structured to lead us to this Kingdom. The Kingdom is the <span class="kingdom-gold">beginning and ending of the ages</span>.

<div class="peters-quote">
“In the ‘eternal purpose,’ or ‘the purpose of the ages,’ etc., is included the notion that time itself is embraced in God’s plan with special reference to Jesus Christ as the King of the kingdom.”
<br>— <em>Prop. 2, Obs. 6</em>
</div>

Whether we look at the Adamic, Abrahamic, or Christian ages, they are “ordered in their succession as part of the Divine purpose in relation to this kingdom” (1 Corinthians 2:7).

### **The Unchanging Nature of the Plan**

Because this plan is rooted in God’s attributes, it cannot be easily cast aside or spiritualized into nothingness.

<div class="peters-quote">
“We also justly infer, that God’s will thus expressed respecting the kingdom indicates a Divine plan, which, in view of His attributes, necessarily embraces unity of design. Therefore, when the kingdom is once defined by the Spirit, no change or modification can possibly be allowed without the most express declarations from God announcing it.”
<br>— <em>Prop. 2, Obs. 7</em>
</div>

Furthermore, “God will undoubtedly accomplish His revealed will concerning it, confirmed as it is even by oath. God Himself stands pledged to the ultimate realization of this idea.”

### **Wisdom Rejoices in the Earth**

Finally, this doctrine vindicates the wisdom of God. It shows a cohesive narrative from Genesis to Revelation. In “Proverbs 8:31, wisdom is represented as <span class="scripture">‘rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth,’</span> and as delighting in or presenting <span class="scripture">‘my delights’</span> to <span class="scripture">‘the sons of men.’</span>”

Ultimately, this grand design proves the existence of a guiding Mind:

<div class="peters-quote">
“The greater the work contemplated—and there is none greater than this kingdom—the more clearly ought we to see the intelligence of the Mind that originates it, and the power of the Will that performs it.”
<br>— <em>Prop. 2, Obs. 9</em>
</div>

### **Conclusion**

The Kingdom is not a secondary ambition of God. It is the <span class="kingdom-gold">original reason for the ground we walk on</span>. As we study Scripture, we find that “known unto God are all His works from the beginning of the world” (Acts 15:18), and we can rest in the certainty that He who designed the foundation will also bring about the glorious capstone.
