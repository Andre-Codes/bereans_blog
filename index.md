### The Kingdom of God: Literal. Covenanted. Coming.

Welcome to **Berean's Blog**, a theological journal dedicated to the systematic study of the <span class="kingdom-gold">Kingdom of God</span>.

In an age where the definition of the Kingdom has become vague and spiritualized, this site exists to recover the precise, biblical hope of the prophets and apostles: the literal reign of the Messiah on the earth.

### Our Primary Study

We are currently working through **George N. H. Peters'** magnum opus, *The Theocratic Kingdom*. This monumental work argues that the Kingdom offered by Jesus was the same Kingdom promised to David—a real, political, and spiritual theocracy on earth—which was rejected by Israel and postponed until the Second Advent.

> "The Kingdom is not the Church, nor the Church the Kingdom; but the Church is the body of heirs gathered out for the Kingdom."
