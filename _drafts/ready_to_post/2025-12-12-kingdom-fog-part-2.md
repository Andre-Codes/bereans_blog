In [Part 1](/2025/12/12/kingdom-fog-part-1/), we established G.N.H. Peters' core critique: when the "Kingdom of God" is severed from its literal Davidic roots, it becomes a "wax nose," capable of being shaped into any form the interpreter desires. Peters predicted that this <span class="kingdom-gold">abandonment of the covenanted definition</span> would lead to a "vague" and "indefinite" theology where the Kingdom means everything and nothing.

The "antagonism" Peters predicted in 1884 is now our reality. In our analysis of modern theology, we find that his warning has come to pass with startling accuracy. The definitions have not converged; they have fractured further. Because the literal definition was abandoned, the 20th and 21st centuries saw the "Kingdom" redefined to suit every emerging philosophical trend, resulting in a landscape of disconnected and contrived meanings.

### **The Modern Divergences: A Survey of Chaos**

The theological landscape of the last century is characterized by a profound <span class="kingdom-gold">semantic deregulation</span>. The Kingdom has transformed from a *destination* (a covenanted empire to come) into a *process* (a moral, political, or evolutionary trajectory). We can categorize the modern "fog" into several distinct divergences, each proving Peters' thesis that without the Davidic root, the Kingdom becomes a vessel for the theologian's own context.

#### **1. The Ecclesiastical Divergence: The Kingdom as Institution**

Just as Peters critiqued those who made the Kingdom "the Church on earth," modern theology has codified this identification in mutually exclusive ways. The sheer variety of "institutional" definitions demonstrates the contrived nature of these interpretations.

* **Roman Catholicism (The Sacramental Kingdom):** The Second Vatican Council’s *Lumen Gentium* defines the Church as the "Kingdom of Christ now present in mystery." Here, the Kingdom is a sacramental reality that "grows visibly" through the Church's work.[^1] It is an organic, mystery-filled expansion of the ecclesiastical hierarchy.  
* **Reformed Theology (The Invisible Kingdom):** In stark contrast to the visible Catholic hierarchy, Louis Berkhof defines the Kingdom as the "invisible Church"—the rule of God established in the hearts of the elect.[^2] Here, the "throne of David" is not an earthly chair or a visible institution, but a spiritual "sphere" of salvation found only in the regenerate heart.  
* **LDS Restorationism (The Corporate Kingdom):** Moving to a startling "structural literalism," Lawrence E. Corbridge of the LDS Church asserts, "The kingdom of God is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."[^3] Here, the Kingdom is neither a mystery nor an invisible concept, but a specific American corporate entity with a defined bureaucracy.

**The Contradiction:** One cannot reconcile a Kingdom that *is* the Roman hierarchy with a Kingdom that *is* the invisible elect, nor with one that *is* the LDS corporation. They are <span class="kingdom-gold">fundamentally different geometries</span> claiming the same biblical title—a "disconnected" landscape where the term "Kingdom" is applied to whatever structure the theologian wishes to validate.

#### **2. The Sociopolitical Divergence: The Kingdom as Justice**

If the ecclesiastical view confines the Kingdom to the Church, the sociopolitical view dissolves it into the world. This stream redefines the Kingdom as a program of social ethics or political liberation.

* **The Social Gospel (State-Building):** Walter Rauschenbusch defined the Kingdom as "humanity organized according to the will of God."[^4] It became a "progressive reign of love" achieved through socialist economic reform and the "Christianizing" of the social order.  
* **Liberation Theology (State-Overthrowing):** Gustavo Gutiérrez radicalized this, defining the Kingdom as the "process of liberation" from oppression.[^5] James Cone further defined it as "the victory of the victims over their victimizers," framing the Kingdom as a counter-hegemonic power struggle.[^6]  
* **Christian Anarchism (State-Rejecting):** Conversely, Leo Tolstoy defined the Kingdom as the *rejection* of all government and authority (including Church and State) in favor of the internal law of love. For Tolstoy, the Kingdom is "within you"—meaning it is the abolition of external law.[^7]

**The Contradiction:** Here, the Kingdom is simultaneously a government program (Rauschenbusch) and the rejection of government (Tolstoy). It is a political revolution (Gutiérrez) and a pacifist withdrawal. Without the anchor of the Davidic Theocracy, the "Kingdom" becomes a <span class="kingdom-gold">synonym for whatever political ideology</span> the interpreter prefers.

#### **3. The Mystical and Evolutionary Divergence: The Kingdom as Process**

A third stream interiorizes the Kingdom into consciousness or biology, stripping it of both political and ecclesiastical structure.

* **Evolutionary Theology:** Pierre Teilhard de Chardin viewed the Kingdom as a "prodigious biological operation"—the evolution of the universe toward the "Omega Point" of complexity.[^8] The Kingdom becomes a property of physics and biology rather than a covenantal promise.  
* **Liberal Progressivism:** Bishop John Shelby Spong stripped the Kingdom of theism entirely, defining it as a symbol for the "fullness of humanity" and "self-actualization."[^9] The Kingdom is not a place, but a "state of life."  
* **Spiritual Formation:** Dallas Willard defined the Kingdom as "the range of God's effective will," privatizing it into a sphere of personal obedience.[^10] While pastorally potent, this definition effectively de-politicizes the concept, turning the Kingdom from a geopolitical reality into a metaphysical space available to the individual mystic.

After surveying these wildly different trajectories—some ecclesiastical, some political, some mystical—the reader begins to feel what Peters himself felt more than a century ago: a doctrine stretched until it tears. He saw the same tendency in his own era, a relentless pressure to make the Kingdom validate whatever movement, institution, or ideology a group wished to justify.

<div class="peters-quote"> “Indeed, no doctrine of the Bible has fared so badly through mere fancy, imagination, enthusiasm, and fanaticism as that of the kingdom. In behalf of a theory or system it has been perverted, distorted, and abused until many persons, looking only at the abuses and antagonism (forgetting that all truth is subject to the same), discard the whole matter. When the Papacy, Shakers, Mormons, etc. define it in a way to embrace their particular organizations; when Anabaptists, Fifth Monarchy men, etc. interpret it so as to include their ambitious projects; when almost every denomination, sect, etc. explain it so as to make themselves the recipients of the kingdom; when it has been prostituted to the basest of purposes, and it is presented in a hundred different aspects and claims—all this only shows how important these parties consider the incorporation and possession in some form, of the doctrine. It is amazing to a person who steadily for years notices the definitions of others, how latitudinarian they have become in these modern days.” <br>—[Prop. 3, Obs. 7](/theocratic-kingdom-full/#obs-7-prop-3) </div>

That tendency didn’t die with the eccentric movements of the 1800s. It just morphed. Unfortunately, modern theology didn’t dodge the problem, it amplified it.

### **The Contemporary Consensus: “Reign, Not Realm”**

Peters argued that once the covenanted definition of the Kingdom was abandoned, even careful and orthodox theologians would be forced to redefine it in increasingly abstract terms. The result would not be open disbelief, but *conceptual drift*; definitions that sound biblical, fit well in a devotional, and yet quietly sever the Kingdom from its immutably concrete, definite, and covenantal foundations.

In an attempt to navigate the theological chaos created by earlier spiritualization, mainstream evangelical theology has largely settled on a shared framework: the Kingdom is understood primarily as God’s *reign* (power or authority), not His *realm* (a promised, territorial government). While this approach avoids the extremes of liberal reductionism, it still leaves the Kingdom divorced from the specific Davidic, national, and geopolitical promises emphasized in Scripture.

What follows illustrates that the same looseness in definition noted among earlier theologians persists, essentially unchanged, in modern theology. These are respected, influential, and broadly orthodox theologians. Yet when their definitions are placed side by side, it becomes clear that they follow the same basic pattern Peters warned about.

What is striking is not so much the diversity of these definitions, but their **convergence**. Despite real differences in theology, emphasis, and ecclesial context, nearly all of these thinkers describe the Kingdom primarily in terms of *influence*, *authority*, or *rule*, rather than as a promised, covenanted dominion centered on David’s throne and Israel’s restoration.

In Peters’ terms, this represents a consistent category error: <span class="kingdom-gold">the **effects** of the Kingdom are substituted for the Kingdom itself</span>. Renewal, obedience, justice, salvation, and transformation are all fruits of the Kingdom...but Scripture never defines them *as* the Kingdom. When the covenantal framework is removed, theology compensates by elevating outcomes into definitions.

Many of these definitions are pastorally rich and spiritually earnest. But Peters’ critique was never primarily moral, it was methodological. Once the Kingdom is detached from prophecy and covenant, even the best theology drifts toward abstraction, until <span class="kingdom-gold">the Kingdom becomes something everywhere present, yet nowhere promised; precisely the fog Peters foresaw.</span>

### **The Psychological Barrier Which Keeps Us in the Fog**

Why do theologians persist in these vague definitions? Peters offers a profound psychological insight into the human tendency to prefer comfortable error over difficult truth. He reminds us of the "fallibility of the most powerful mind" and our proneness to arrogate to ourselves the right to construct meaning rather than submit to the "plain, grammatical language" of God.

But the deeper reason is fear. We fear that investigating the foundations of our cherished beliefs might prove them sandy. We prefer the comfort of tradition to the disruption of truth.

<div class="peters-quote">
“Many shrink from investigation when they find that things which they fondly believed, incorporated in their prayers and hopes, and portrayed with eloquence, are subject to the suspicion of being built upon a sandy foundation... This may indeed be an amiable weakness, but it is one as fatal to the student as Delilah’s hands were to Samson.”
<br>—[Prop. 3, Obs. 14](/theocratic-kingdom-full/#obs-14-prop-3)
</div>

This "amiable weakness" blinds us. We are comfortable with the "friendly" error of a spiritualized Kingdom that validates our current church programs. We are less comfortable with the "adversary" of a literal Kingdom that declares our current efforts insufficient and points to a future Divine intervention. As Peters warns:

<div class="peters-quote">
“Error, too, is often plausible and friendly; truth sometimes comes in the garb of an adversary.”
<br>—[Prop. 3, Obs. 13](/theocratic-kingdom-full/#obs-13-prop-3)
</div>

### The Cost of "Fancy"

In Peters’ terms, what we are witnessing is not mere diversity of emphasis but a decisive <span class="kingdom-gold">departure from the original and primitive meaning</span> of the Kingdom. He freely acknowledges, alongside historians and critics alike, that Christianity has undergone changes since its introduction. Yet the issue is not whether change has occurred, but **what has been changed**. When the Kingdom as preached by the early Church is compared with the meanings now “so extensively given and adopted,” Peters concludes that the departure is unmistakable and severe.

<div class="peters-quote">
“When comparing the early Church doctrine of the kingdom with the meanings now so extensively given and adopted, a wide departure from the original and primitive meaning is fully evidenced.”
<br>—[Prop. 3, Obs. 10](/theocratic-kingdom-full/#obs-10-prop-3)
</div>

This is not development but substitution. Peters is careful to note that the modern doctrine does not merely differ; <span class="kingdom-gold">it stands in opposition to the original, assuming “the attitude of hostility” toward what the Church first believed and proclaimed.</span> The Kingdom has not been clarified; it has been replaced. And in that replacement, the Church has not abandoned religious language, but redefined i; calling opinions “religion,” systems “fundamentals,” and fancies “faith.”

<div class="peters-quote">
“Men will call all opinions by the name of religion; and superstructures by the name of fundamental articles; and fancies by the glorious appellation of faith.”
<br>—Jer. Taylor, cited in Prop. 3, Obs. 10
</div>

Peters does not attribute this drift to malice, but to a deeper and more troubling cause: human fallibility joined with intellectual confidence. Even the most learned minds, operating under the most favorable circumstances, are prone to error, especially when convinced of their own correctness. This explains how the Kingdom could be so thoroughly reimagined while remaining clothed in biblical vocabulary.

<div class="peters-quote">
“We realize… the fallibility of the most powerful mind even under the most favorable circumstances, and in its moments of highest confidence.”
<br>—[Prop. 3, Obs. 11](/theocratic-kingdom-full/#obs-11-prop-3)
</div>

Here lies the great irony. God foresaw this weakness. He anticipated the limits of human intellect and graciously accommodated Himself to them—not through obscurity, but through clarity. He bound His promises in covenant. He expressed His purposes in plain, grammatical language. He spoke so as to be understood.

<div class="peters-quote">
“God foresaw this diversity, and hence accommodated Himself to our weakness in the plain, grammatical language and sense in which He expresses Himself.”
<br>—[Prop. 3, Obs. 11](/theocratic-kingdom-full/#obs-11-prop-3)
</div>

Yet theology repeatedly treats this divine accommodation as insufficient. In what Peters calls our “superior wisdom,” we add to what God has said—replacing the grammatical sense with constructions of what the sense *ought* to be. In doing so, we do not escape confusion; we manufacture it.

The result is the very fog this series has traced: a Kingdom everywhere present, endlessly defined, yet nowhere fixed—precisely because it has been detached from covenant, prophecy, and promise. The early Church did not suffer this confusion. It preached a Kingdom still future, covenanted, and destined for public manifestation under the Messiah. It did not divide it, spiritualize it, or internalize it into abstraction.

To recover the Kingdom, then, is not to invent a new theology, but to abandon our confidence in theological ingenuity and return to the clarity God has already provided. When we spiritualize the prophecies, we do not deepen their meaning, we destroy their precision.

The remedy remains unchanged and unavoidable: to adopt legitimate principles of interpretation and never depart from them.
